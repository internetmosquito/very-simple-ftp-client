* Version 1.1.1 : Fixed a bug in deleteDir method that was making not possible to delete a directory. Mostly
                  changed the way the directory to delete was being obtained after changing to parent directory

* Version 1.1.2 : Modified build.xml so it includes ftp4j and log4j classes in the final JAR, thus we have an uber-jar
                  ready to use. Probably using OneJar ant task. 
                  
                  Migrating the project to GitHub...Google Code is just a nightmare, plain and simple
